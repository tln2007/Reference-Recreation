          <p> Vignelli-isms Poster series.<br>
              In recognition of his outstanding <br>
              contribution to the world of <br>
              graphic design. </p>

          <p> On the evening of Tuesday, March 8,
              The Architectural League gave its
              Presidentâ€™s Medal to Lella and
              Massimo Vignelli. </p>

          <p> In 1971, Massimo founded Vignelli <br>
              Associates with his wife, Lella. <br>
              He and his wife continue to work <br>
              from their New York office. </p>

          <p> Vignelli was involved with filmmaker
              Gary Hustwit in the documentary
              Helvetica, about the typeface of the
              same name. Vignelli also recently
              updated his 1972 New York City
              subway map. </p>

          Vignelli works firmly within the Modernist
          tradition, and focuses on simplicity
          through the use of basic geometric forms
          in all of his work.  </div>
